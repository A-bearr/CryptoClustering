# CryptoClustering
##Mod 19 challenge 

This project applies unsupervised machine learning techniques to identify natural groupings in the cryptocurrency market using a dataset of key crypto performance metrics. The goal is to analyze how clustering outcomes differ when using the original feature set versus reduced dimensionality via PCA.

## Project Goals

Normalize cryptocurrency market data
Use K-Means clustering to group similar cryptocurrencies
Apply PCA to reduce dimensionality and compare results
Visualize and interpret the effectiveness of both approaches

## Dataset

The dataset (crypto_market_data.csv) contains metrics for various cryptocurrencies, including:

Price change percentages over time
Volume and volatility data
Market momentum indicators

## Methods

Data Normalization:
All numeric features were scaled using StandardScaler to ensure equal weighting.
K-Means Clustering:
An elbow method was used to determine the optimal number of clusters (k=4) for both the original and PCA-transformed datasets.
PCA (Principal Component Analysis):
Dimensionality was reduced to 3 principal components, capturing ~89.5% of the variance in the data.
Visualization:
Elbow curves for both datasets
Cluster scatter plots using both original features and PCA-transformed data
Side-by-side comparisons for interpretability

## Results

Optimal number of clusters (k):
Both the original and PCA-reduced data suggested an optimal k=4.
Impact of PCA:
Clustering results were broadly consistent, but PCA helped simplify the visualization and highlighted the most influential components, making patterns easier to observe.

## Technologies Used
Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, HVPlot, PCA, KMeans)
Jupyter Notebook
CSV Data Handling
Data Visualization with Holoviews/HVPlot

## Conclusion

Clustering cryptocurrencies using unsupervised learning can reveal meaningful groupings and market patterns. PCA proves to be a powerful tool in simplifying the data without significant loss of information, making it easier to visualize and interpret clusters.
